       "The LSTM model shows a stronger dependency on the GDP increase, which might be too optimistic an outlook, although it depends on the actual socio-economic context. If other factors such as social support and freedom are equally important in real-world considerations, the XGBoost model that attributes similar importance to all three factors might be a better option. \n",
       "\n",
       "Given that policy planning has to often balance between different sorts of interventions, a model that doesn't overemphasize one factor over others would generally be more useful. Therefore, based on the available information, the XGBoost model might be more reliable for policy planning. But it would be very useful to also have confidence intervals or some measure of uncertainty for these predictions, to sophisticatedly guide policy decisions based on machine learning models."
